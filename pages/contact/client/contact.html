  <h2>Can I switch my meal plan?</h2>

  <p>Absolutely. Our goal is to offer users ample flexibility to meet specific
    lifestyle and family needs. We offer unlimited switching for our users both
    from the website or the app (iOS and Android).</p>

  <h2>What if I don’t want to use all seven dinner menus on my plan?</h2>

  <p>We know there are times when you won’t use all seven dinner menus, so our
    weekly goal is to provide plenty of variety and inspiration for you to pick
     and choose the meals that most appeal to you and your family. In the app,
     you can easily select the meals that you want for the week, and the app
     will automatically create the shopping list based on your selection.</p>

  <h2>May I get lower price if I only want a dinner-only plans?</h2>

  <p>We charge the same price for a three-meals-a-day plan and a dinner-only
     meal plan since it takes similar time and energy to prepare them. </p>
